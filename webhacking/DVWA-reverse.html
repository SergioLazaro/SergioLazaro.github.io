<h3>Damn Vulnerable Web Application - Command execution + File upload = Reverse shell ;) </h3>

Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment.

Well, when I first saw this vulnerable web application I thought that it was a good idea installing it in a Raspberry instead of installing it in a VM. This is a dummy idea and something you should never do cause... it's fucking vulnerable!

One day, you know, when you remember you have a raspberry and could help you, I tried to log in but I forgot the username/password. F**k... I have to format the SD card and reinstall the OS. Thinking about the previous use of that awesome tool I figured out that I was learning some web hacking so... Why can't I hack my own raspberry?

This post deals with some basic concepts on web hacking and how to p0wn the DVWA using a simple python reverse shell, file upload and command execution features. To success, I had to exploit two vulnerabilities (low difficulty - modify cookies if you want) and I finally got the shell.

<h4> Exploit File Upload vulnerability </h4>

First of all I tested this functionality that looks like the picture below.
